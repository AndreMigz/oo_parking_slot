# OO Parking Slot (Backend) üöó

## System Description
- This system is designed to enhance parking efficiency by pre-assigning parking slots to vehicles upon their arrival at the mall's entry points. Here are the key features and constraints of the system:

1. **Entry Points:**
   - The parking complex starts with three (3) entry points, with the possibility to add more in the future.
   - Vehicles are assigned the nearest available parking slot to the entry point they use.

2. **Vehicle and Slot Types:**
   - Vehicles are categorized into three types: small (S), medium (M), and large (L).
   - Parking slots are also categorized into three sizes: small (SP), medium (MP), and large (LP).
   - Compatibility:
     - S vehicles can park in SP, MP, and LP slots.
     - M vehicles can park in MP and LP slots.
     - L vehicles can park only in LP slots.

3. **Fee Calculation:**
   - A flat rate of 40 pesos is charged for the first three (3) hours for all vehicle types.
   - After the initial three hours, the hourly rates are:
     - 20 pesos/hour for SP slots.
     - 60 pesos/hour for MP slots.
     - 100 pesos/hour for LP slots.
   - For parking durations exceeding 24 hours, each full 24-hour period is charged at 5,000 pesos. Any remaining hours are charged as per the above rates.
   - Fees are rounded up to the nearest hour (e.g., 6.4 hours is rounded to 7 hours).
   - If a vehicle exits and returns within one hour, it is charged a continuous rate as if it did not leave. Otherwise, standard rates apply.

5. **Functions:**
   - The system includes functions to park and unpark vehicles.
   - When a vehicle is parked, the system assigns a slot based on the vehicle type and entry point.
   - When a vehicle is unparked, the system calculates and returns the parking fee based on the duration and slot size.

    - Endpoint: `/park`
    - Method: `POST `
    - Request body:
      ```json
      {
        "vehicle_id": "your_vehicle_id",
